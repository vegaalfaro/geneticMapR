`geneticMapper` simplifies and streamlines the construction of genetic maps through an organized, reproducible workflow. Built on top of [MapRtools](https://github.com/jendelman/MapRtools) and [R/qtl](https://rqtl.org/), it makes genetic mapping more accessible while supporting flexible analysis. Optimized for F2 diploid plant populations, many functions were generalized to potentially other species and different **ploidy levels**.

## Value
Genetic map construction involves several practical challenges. `geneticMapper` was designed to help 
with reproducible genetic map construction and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `geneticMapper` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# Get pak if needed
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pak")
}

#Install geneticMapper
pak::pak("vegaalfaro/geneticMapper")

# Load library
library(geneticMapper)
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# Load the example dataset
data("simulated_geno")

# Check markers previous to recoding
print(simulated_geno)

# Recode the markers using the recode() function
phased <- geneticMapper::recode(simulated_geno, parent1 = "Parent1", parent2 = "Parent2")

```


```{r}
# Print the output
print(phased)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so
