\title{Trim Linkage Groups Based on LOD Thresholds}
\usage{
trim_LG(
  chromosome,
  map,
  geno,
  pop_type = "F2",
  drop_outliers = TRUE,
  n_cores = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chromosome}{Character. The chromosome ID to be processed.}

\item{map}{A data frame containing marker map information with at least the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{"marker"}: Marker names.
\item \code{"chrom"}: Chromosome identifier.
\item \code{"position"}: Physical position of markers.
}}

\item{geno}{A genotype matrix where:
\itemize{
\item Rows represent genetic markers.
\item Columns represent individuals.
\item Values represent genotype calls.
Preferably, a binned genotype matrix. Binning can be performed using \code{MapRtools::LDbin}.
}}

\item{pop_type}{Character. The population type used for linkage estimation. Default is \code{"F2"}. Would work with any of the following "DH","BC","F2","S1","RIL.self","RIL.sib". Based on \code{MapRtools::MLEL()}}

\item{drop_outliers}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, removes markers identified as outliers based on haplotype frequency. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. The number of CPU cores to use for linkage estimation.
If \code{NULL}, the function selects the maximum available minus one.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{"trimmed_genotype"}: The filtered genotype matrix.
\item \code{"final_map"}: The updated marker map after filtering.
\item \code{"initial_haplo_plot"}: A \code{ggplot2} object showing the initial haplotype plot.
\item \code{"filtered_freq_plot"}: A \code{ggplot2} object showing the haplotype plot after filtering.
\item \code{"final_freq_plot"}: A \code{ggplot2} object showing the haplotype frequency after removing outliers.
\item \code{"starting_LOD"}: A record of the user-specified initial LOD threshold.
\item \code{"ending_LOD"}: A record of the the user-specified final LOD threshold.
\item \code{"step"}: A record of the LOD sequence step size.
\item \code{"selected_LOD_thresh"}: The final LOD threshold used for filtering markers.
\item \code{"outliers"}: Markers removed as outliers saved as character vector.
}
}
\description{
\code{trim_LG}  is an interactive function that helps the user filter markers within a specified chromosome based on linkage
group (LG) assignment using LOD score thresholds. \code{trim_LG}  should make the process easy by allowing the user
to choose the thresholds interactively, visualize haplotype frequency before and after filtering,
and  remove outliers. Inspired by functions by Professor Jeffrey B. Endelman's \href{https://github.com/jendelman/MapRtools}{MapRtools}
available in Github. \code{trim_LG} provides a simple interphase for trimming LGs easily.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Computes LOD scores for marker pairs using \code{MapRtools::MLEL()}, parallelized with multiple cores.
\item Displays an interactive "candy stripe" plot for visualizing linkage groups using \code{MapRtools::LG()}.
\item Asks the user to define a LOD range and a final LOD threshold for marker filtering.
\item If \code{drop_outliers = TRUE}, removes markers identified as outliers based on haplotype frequency.

Requires a previous installation of \href{https://github.com/jendelman/MapRtools}{MapRtools}.
This function was refined with assistance from ChatGPT to improve readability,
efficiency, and visualization formatting.
