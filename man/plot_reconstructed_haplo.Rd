\title{Plot Haplotype Reconstruction Results Before and After HMM}
\usage{
plot_reconstructed_haplo(original, processed, individuals = 1:50)
}
\arguments{
\item{original}{A genotype matrix before haplotype reconstruction. Rows represent markers,
and columns represent individuals.}

\item{processed}{A genotype matrix after HMM-based haplotype reconstruction. It must have
the same dimensions as \code{original}.}

\item{individuals}{A numeric vector specifying the indices of individuals (columns) to plot.
Default is \code{1:50}. All values must be within the column range of the input matrices.}
}
\value{
A list with two ggplot objects:
\describe{
\item{p1}{Genotype plot before HMM, titled with the chromosome name and "Before HMM".}
\item{p2}{Genotype plot after HMM, titled with the chromosome name and "After HMM".}
}
}
\description{
\code{plot_reconstructed_haplo} visualizes the genotype data before and after HMM-based haplotype reconstruction
for a specified set of individuals. It uses \code{MapRtools::plot_geno()} for visualization
and appends informative titles based on the chromosome name.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{extract_map()} from \code{geneticMapper} to infer the chromosome name from the original
genotype matrix, which is then used to annotate the plots. Both matrices are expected
to be compatible with \code{MapRtools::plot_geno()}.
