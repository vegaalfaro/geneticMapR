`geneticMapR` is an R package designed to simplify the construction of genetic maps and QTL analysis using molecular markers in F~2~ bi-parental populations. 

Genetic map construction is often overlooked in the genetic mapping literature and can be time-consuming. This package aims to make the process reproducible and to provide tools for QTL visualization and plant genetic research.

Functions in `geneticMapR` and key mapping steps will be illustrated using a real dataset from *Beta vulgaris* (table beet), an outcrossing species. The F~2~ population was derived from crosses between Conical × Round and Cylindrical × Round inbred lines, representing distinct root shapes. The challenges posed by the outcrossing nature of *Beta vulgaris* will help highlight practical solutions for common problems in genetic mapping.

My early genetic maps were difficult to reproduce and prone to mistakes. I hope `geneticMapR` supports your journey toward reliable and reproducible genetic maps.

## Installation

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
# Get devtools if needed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

#Install geneticMapR
devtools::install_github("vegaalfaro/geneticMapR")

```

## Where to start?

`geneticMapR` helps you construct genetic maps in F~2~ mapping populations. While it is primarily designed for diploid species, some functions also support polyploids.

To get started, you’ll need a few essential files:

* **Genotype file**: A matrix where individuals are scored for their genotype across multiple loci in the genome.

* **Phenotype file**: One or more traits measured across individuals, possibly across time or environments (multi-environment trials), depending on your species.

`geneticMapR` provides example data to walk you through the mapping process. We'll start with an example `VCF`[https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf] file which is the typical output of next generation sequencing platforms like genotyping by sequencing ([GBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping_by_sequencing))



## Recommendations

When genotyping, it is critical to include DNA from the parental lines and the F~1~ individuals. Ideally, this should be from the actual plants used to create the population, especially in outcrossing species like carrot or beet.

If tissue from the original parents or F~1~ is unavailable, use samples from other plants of the same genotype. However, in outcrossing species, even inbred lines may show unexpected diversity. I’ve seen this firsthand in carrots.

Parental genotypes are essential for *recoding* or *phasing* markers to reflect parental inheritance, a core step in genetic mapping. They’re also helpful for resolving problematic markers and understanding residual heterozygosity, which is common in many populations.

Having the parents and F~1~ genotyped will prove invaluable for a genetic mapping project.

## Using Your Own Data

You can use your own genotype matrix (from a VCF or GBS pipeline) with `geneticMapR`. Functions like `convert_to_dosage()` and `convert_to_dosage_flex()` help format raw genotype calls into phased numeric values compatible with the package.

For unfiltered VCF-derived matrices, make sure to:

* Filter for bi-allelic SNPs.
* Remove non-polymorphic markers. 
* Keep only SNPs with sufficient depth and genotype quality scores, it varies for each project or population.
